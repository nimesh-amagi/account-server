This repository will hold account-server code for SSP system.
Documentation in google-docs will refer to this as Backend ERP but to keep the naming easy, we will go ahead with account-server.
This is Spring Framework based project and it used Spring Boot for web application, that means there is no need of any other web server, just run the compiled jar and you are set.

To build:
gradle clean build

To run:
java -jar build/*.jar
